Throw Try/Catch in the üóëÔ∏è Level up your React error handling with the Result type

Tired of guessing if that imported function throws, or maybe you‚Äôre losing sleep from being paged for an unhanded promise rejection at 2am? Error handling is insidiously difficult to get right in React and TypeScript.

This talk introduces the Result type - a simple, powerful, and pragmatic game-changer for managing errors in React applications. We'll explore how to leverage Result types in conjunction with React's Error & Suspense Boundaries to create more robust, type-safe, and maintainable code.

Say goodbye to unexpected crashes and hello to graceful, typed, and exhaustive error management that your future self (and your team) will thank you for.
