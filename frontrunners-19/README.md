# Event Driven Redux

## Description

Redux, having been released in 2015, quickly rose to become the defacto standard for state management in modern UI development. However, like with many technologies facing explosive growth and adoption, many people began to use and learn it without the context behind its creation, the problems it solved, and the pros and cons of using it as a state management solution.  As a result, lots of material, blog posts, and tutorials were put out on best practices, common conventions, and “rules” for using Redux. Over time, however, a lot of these best practices lead to common complaints such as there being too much boilerplate, too much complexity, and our component API’s being too tightly coupled to reducers and redux.

In this talk, I’d like to demonstrate how we can challenge the status quo of best practices with Redux.  I’d like to examine how if we adopt a mental shift of viewing actions as events rather than commands, we can decouple our UI from Redux, reduce boilerplate, and build more robust applications.
